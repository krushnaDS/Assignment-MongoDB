A Schema-less database means one\\ncollection can hold different types of documents in it.

It is not necessary that the one document is similar to another document \\nlike in the relational databases. Due to this cool feature, MongoDB provides great flexibility to databases.\\nDocument Oriented: In MongoDB, all the data stored in the documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. \\nIn these documents, the data is stored in fields(key-value pair) instead of rows and columns which make\\nthe data much more flexible in comparison to RDBMS. And each document contains its unique object id.\\n\\n2. Indexing: In MongoDB database, every field in the documents is indexed with primary and secondary \\nindices this makes easier and takes less time to get or search data from the pool of the data. If the\\ndata is not indexed, then database search each document with the specified query which takes lots of time and not so efficient.\\n\\n3. Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding. \\nSharding means to distribute data on multiple servers, here a large amount of data \\nis partitioned into data chunks using the shard key, and these data chunks are evenly \\ndistributed across shards that reside across many physical servers. It will also add new machines to a running database.\\n\\n4. Replication: MongoDB provides high availability and redundancy with the help of replication,\\nit creates multiple copies of the data and sends these copies to a different server so that if \\none server fails, then the data is retrieved from another server.\\n\\n5. Aggregation: It allows to perform operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result.\\nIt is similar to the SQL GROUPBY clause. It provides three different aggregations i.e, aggregation pipeline, \\nmap-reduce function, and single-purpose aggregation methods\\n\\n6.
